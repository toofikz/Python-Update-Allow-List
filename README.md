# Python-Update-Allow-List
In this project, I created a Python algorithm to automate the process of updating an "allow_list.txt" file that contains approved IP addresses. The algorithm removes IP addresses from the allow list that are also present in a separate "remove_list". This ensures that restricted content is only accessible to authorized IP addresses.
